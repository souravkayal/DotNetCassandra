Implementation of CRUD Operation in .NET with Cassandra Database

This example is to demonstrate how we can implement basic CRUD operation using Cassandra Database. I have used Datastax (https://docs.datastax.com) library to connect to Cassandra sandbox database. The example is just to show working CRUD operation without following any design principle or best practice.
